    <h3>What is the Red Panda Network?</h3>
    <p>Founded by Brian Williams in 2007, Red Panda Network has become a world leader in efforts to protect red pandas and their habitat.</p>        <p>Their conservation programs extend to over one million acres of forest and 50% of Nepalâ€™s red panda range! They work with community partners in 10 districts (of 23 red panda range districts) in Nepal with over 50 Community Forest User Groups in adopting sustainable forest management practices.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #ff7374">Conservation Efforts</h3>
    <p>The people living in their project areas in Nepal are on the frontlines of conservation and are their most important allies for saving the red panda. They are often rural communities, living in poverty, who depend on a wide range of natural resources and ecosystem services for their well-being. Unfortunately, this means they are more vulnerable when biodiversity is degraded or lost.</p>
    <p>But the environment and economy are interdependent. As the forests and wildlife are protected, pressure on forest resources is alleviated and the livelihoods of local people improve as well as their resistance to environmental and climatic changes.</p>
